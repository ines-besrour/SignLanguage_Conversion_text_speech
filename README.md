# SignLanguage_Conversion_text_speech
A deep learning-based project that converts sign language gestures into text and speech, enabling real-time communication between sign language users and non-signers.

Text To Speech Translation:
The model translates known gestures into words. We have used pyttsx3 library to convert the recognized words into the appropriate speech. The text-to-speech output is a simple workaround, but it's a useful feature because it simulates a real-life dialogue.
